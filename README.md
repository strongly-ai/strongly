    print("User ID:", models_data['userId'])
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

### Fetching Applied Filters

To fetch the applied filters from the Strongly API:

```python
from py_strongly import APIClient

client = APIClient()

try:
    filters_data = client.get_applied_filters()

## Testing

We strive to maintain high code quality and reliability in this package. To this end, we've included a comprehensive test suite. Here's how you can run the tests and contribute to maintaining the package's quality.

### Prerequisites

Before running the tests, make sure you have the required testing dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

### Running the Tests
To run the entire test suite, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the root directory of the package.
Run the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This command will discover and run all the tests in the tests/ directory.

### Understanding Test Output
The test output will show you:

* Which tests passed (marked with . or PASSED)
* Which tests failed (marked with F or FAILED)
* The overall test summary
* Code coverage report

### Running Specific Tests
If you want to run a specific test file or test function, you can do so by specifying the path:

```bash
# Run tests in a specific file
pytest tests/strongly.py

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/strongly.py::test_authenticate_success
```

### Code Coverage
Our pytest.ini file is configured to run coverage reports automatically. After running the tests, you'll see a coverage report in the console output. For a more detailed report, you can run:

```bash
pytest --cov-report=html
```

This will generate an HTML coverage report in the htmlcov/ directory. Open htmlcov/index.html in a web browser to view it.

### Continuous Integration
We use [CI service name, e.g., GitHub Actions] for continuous integration. Every pull request is automatically tested to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.

### Contributing to Tests
If you're adding new features or fixing bugs, please consider adding appropriate tests. This helps maintain the package's reliability and makes it easier for others to understand and verify your changes.

If you have any questions about testing or need help interpreting test results, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
